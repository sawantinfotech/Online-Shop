## Configuration Requirements

### For Gmail Users (Current Setup)

You're using Gmail (sawantinfotech@gmail.com) which requires special authentication:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication**:
   - Go to myaccount.google.com
   - Navigate to Security
   - Enable 2-Step Verification

2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Visit myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" as the app
   - Generate a 16-character app password
   - Use this password instead of your regular Gmail password

3. **Update EMAIL_PASSWORD**:
   - Replace your current EMAIL_PASSWORD with the generated app password
   - The app password looks like: "abcd efgh ijkl mnop"

### Environment Variables

```bash
EMAIL_ADDRESS=sawantinfotech@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com (optional, defaults to Gmail)
SMTP_PORT=587 (optional, defaults to 587)
```

## Testing the Email System

### 1. Command Line Test
```bash
python test_email_connection.py
```

### 2. Web Interface Test
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/test-email`
- Check configuration status
- Send test emails
- Verify connectivity

### 3. Integration Test
- Register a new business
- Place a test order
- Verify automated emails are sent

## Email Integration Points

### In Order Processing (`routes.py`)
```python
# Order confirmation
if order_created:
    send_order_confirmation_email(order)
    
# Payment confirmation
if payment_successful:
    send_payment_confirmation_email(order, payment)
    
# Status updates
if status_changed:
    send_order_status_update_email(order, old_status, new_status)
```

### In Invoice Generation (`utils.py`)
```python
# Invoice email with PDF attachment
if invoice_generated:
    send_invoice_email(order, invoice_path)
```

## Security Features

1. **TLS Encryption**: All emails sent over secure connection
2. **Authentication**: Proper SMTP authentication
3. **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam and abuse
5. **Content Validation**: Ensures proper email formatting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Application-specific password required"**
   - Solution: Generate Gmail App Password as described above

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Check EMAIL_ADDRESS and EMAIL_PASSWORD are correct
   - Verify 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
   - Ensure App Password is used for Gmail

3. **"Connection timeout"**
   - Check SMTP server and port settings
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check firewall settings

4. **"Email not received"**
   - Check spam/junk folders
   - Verify recipient email address
   - Check email logs for delivery status

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test email configuration
python test_email_connection.py

# Check email settings
python -c "from email_service import get_email_settings; print(get_email_settings())"

# Test SMTP connection only
python -c "from email_service import test_email_connection; print(test_email_connection())"
```

## Email Delivery Status

2. **Monitor Logs**: Check email delivery logs regularly
3. **Update Credentials**: Rotate app passwords periodically
4. **Backup Configuration**: Keep email settings documented
5. **Customer Communication**: Inform customers about email notifications

## Next Steps

1. **Configure App Password**: Set up Gmail App Password
