## Alternative: Use Different Email Provider

If Gmail setup is complex, you can use other providers:

### Option 1: Outlook/Hotmail
```
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_regular_password
SMTP_SERVER=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

### Option 2: Yahoo Mail
```
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

## Email System Features Ready
Once configured, your customers will receive:
- Professional order confirmations
- Payment receipts
- Shipping notifications
- Invoice PDFs

The entire email system is built and ready - just needs the correct authentication.
